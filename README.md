Playing with the AccuWeather API.

Simple, initially procedural, investigation of the Accuweather API.

Get an API key from [the Accuweather Developer Portal](http://developer.accuweather.com/home). Create an application and copy your key into a file called globs.py as follows:

API_KEY = "The Key Provided for your App at the above url"

Hope to eventually create a Flask app to consume the API.
